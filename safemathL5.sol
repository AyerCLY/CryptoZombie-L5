//What's an overflow?
//Let's say we have a uint8, which can only have 8 bits. That means the largest number we can store is binary 11111111 (or in decimal, 2^8 - 1 = 255).
//Take a look at the following code. What is number equal to at the end?
//uint8 number = 255;
//number++;
//In this case, we've caused it to overflow â€” so number is counterintuitively now equal to 0 even though we increased it. (If you add 1 to binary 11111111, it resets back to 00000000, like a clock going from 23:59 to 00:00).
//An underflow is similar, where if you subtract 1 from a uint8 that equals 0, it will now equal 255 (because uints are unsigned, and cannot be negative).
//While we're not using uint8 here, and it seems unlikely that a uint256 will overflow when incrementing by 1 each time (2^256 is a really big number), it's still good to put protections in our contract so that our DApp never has unexpected behavior in the future.
//To prevent this, OpenZeppelin has created a library called SafeMath that prevents these issues by default.
