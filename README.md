# CryptoZombie-L5
ERC721 &amp; Crypto-Collectibles
Let's recap:
In this lesson we learned about:

Tokens, the ERC721 standard, and tradable assets/zombies
Libraries and how to use them
How to prevent overflows and underflows using the SafeMath library
Commenting your code and the natspec standard
This lesson concludes our game's Solidity code! (For now â€” we may add even more lessons in the future).

In the next 2 lessons, we're going to look at how to deploy your contracts and interact with them using web3.js (so you can build a front-end for your DApp).

Go ahead and rename any of your zombies if you like, then proceed to the next chapter to complete the lesson.
